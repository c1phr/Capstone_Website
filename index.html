                    From concerts to conferences to a day on the slopes, groups of friends enjoy doing things together.  Although the group may split up repeatedly as everyone does their thing, they coordinate, meet up again, and generally "hang out" together fluidly throughout the day.  Unfortunately, it is managing exactly this fluid group coordination that is problematic.  Someone is always taking the wrong door, or can't find the meeting place...and maintaining a sense for where everyone is at any moment in impossible.  Text messaging and phone calls tend to be inefficient, with half the time spent trying to describe where everyone is.  Many “chat” applications exist, but these require memberships and lengthy setup, and still don't help with the physical location of group members. Our TooGether application provides fresh take on lightweight group organization, with effortless instant group creation, easy-intragroup communication, and a map view to track the location of all members.
